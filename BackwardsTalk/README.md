###Description###

Your kids always talk in their ’secret language’. By bribing one of them with chocolate you learned that they actually 
speak backwards. So you bought an audio recorder in order to translate what they said later on.

Manually reverse their backwards talk word by word to know what they say! 
(e.g. “looc” results in "cool")
